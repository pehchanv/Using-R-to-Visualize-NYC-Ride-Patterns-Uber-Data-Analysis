# Using-R-to-Visualize-NYC-Ride-Patterns-Uber-Data-Analysis
**Project Overview**

- Analyzes Uber trip data (Aprilâ€“September 2014) in New York City.

- Uses R for data cleaning, wrangling, and visualization.

- Focuses on exploring temporal trends (hour, day, month, weekday) and spatial patterns (heatmaps, NYC maps).

- Provides insights into demand patterns by time, base, and geography.

**Code**

- Main implementation is provided in the R script/notebook.

- Includes data preprocessing, aggregation, and visualization steps.

**How to Use**

- Download the Uber dataset from this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-OQJcNCoOfjR3zsiihbALLVwG4LGtruY
 - Put the CSV files in your working directory.

- Open the R script and update the setwd() path to match your local directory.



**Results**

- Distribution of trips by hour, day, and month.

- Heatmaps showing demand patterns across time and location.

- Visualizations of trips by base and day of week.

- NYC maps plotting ride pickup locations with and without base differentiation.

**Future Work**

- Extend analysis to later years of Uber data for comparison.

- Automate reporting with R Markdown.

- Apply clustering methods to identify high-demand zones.
